## How Automatic Raffle Entry Works

1. **Registration**: You register your API key with `!setapikey`
2. **Webhook Reception**: When a raffle becomes active, Alphabot sends a notification to our bot
3. **Automatic Entry**: The bot automatically tries to enter all registered users into the raffle
4. **Notifications**: You'll receive a direct message about whether the entry was successful

## Notifications

The bot will send you direct messages for:
- ‚úÖ Successful raffle entries
- ‚ùå Failed raffle entries (with reason)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API key issues or errors

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to be online for automatic entries?
**A**: No! The bot works 24/7. As long as you're registered, it will try to enter you into raffles even when you're offline.

### Q: Can I use the same API key on multiple Discord accounts?
**A**: Each Discord account needs its own unique Alphabot API key. Using the same key on multiple accounts may cause issues.

### Q: What happens if my API key expires or becomes invalid?
**A**: The bot will notify you via direct message if there are issues with your API key. You'll need to update it with a new one.

### Q: Can I see which raffles I've been entered into?
**A**: The bot will send you notifications for each entry attempt. You can also check your Alphabot profile for entry history.

### Q: Is my API key secure?
**A**: Yes! The bot automatically deletes messages containing API keys, and keys are stored securely on the server. However, never share your API key with others.

### Q: Can I disable automatic entries temporarily?
**A**: Use `!removekey` to stop automatic entries. Use `!setapikey` again when you want to resume.

### Q: What if the bot doesn't respond to my commands?
**A**: Check that:
- The bot is online (green status in Discord)
- You're using the correct command format
- You have permission to send messages in the channel
- Try using commands in a direct message with the bot

## Error Messages and Solutions

### "‚ùå You need to set your API key first"
**Solution**: Use `!setapikey YOUR_API_KEY` to register

### "‚ùå API key seems too short"
**Solution**: Check that you copied the complete API key from Alphabot

### "‚ùå Failed to join raffle: Invalid API key"
**Solution**: Your API key may have expired. Get a new one from Alphabot and update with `!setapikey`

### "‚ùå Failed to join raffle: Rate limited"
**Solution**: The bot hit Alphabot's rate limits. It will automatically retry. No action needed.

### "‚ùå Failed to join raffle: Already entered"
**Solution**: You're already entered in this raffle. This is normal and expected.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep your API key private**: Never share it in public channels
2. **Update regularly**: If you get a new API key from Alphabot, update it in the bot
3. **Monitor notifications**: Check your direct messages for entry results
4. **Use `!status` regularly**: Verify you're still registered, especially after Alphabot updates
5. **Be patient**: During high-traffic periods, entries may take a few moments to process
